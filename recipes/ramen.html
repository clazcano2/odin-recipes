        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A nice and hot steaming bowl of ramen
            that is easy to make and delicious to digest.
            This is no cup noodles, this is a REAL LIFE bowl
            of Ichiraku ramen you see in Naruto.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages of Top Ramen</li>
            <li>5 cups of pork/beef broth</li>
            <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 baby bok choy</li>
            <li>1 green onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li><em>optional: Aburage, Nori, Kamaboko</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours. You can 
                use just soy sauce, or a mixture of whatever other Asian 
                sauces you want. Teriyaki would be good, as would some mirin.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F, then cook the tenderloin for 
                12-15 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.
            </li>
            <li>Put eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and
                cover with a lid. It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the eggs. 
                Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.
            </li>
            <li>While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring 
                it to a simmer. You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste. 
            </li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles. DO NOT add in the flavor packets.
                Let that cook.
            </li>
            <li>Now, we cut up all the toppings! Peel the eggs and slice them in half, cut the pork
                , kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin slices.
            </li>
            <li>Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the ingredients in
                groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori. Itadakimasu!
            </li>
        </ol>
